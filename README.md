# TODO

* [X] Naive Prange/Lee-Brickell implementation
* [ ] Naive Stern implentation
* [ ] SIMD-ed popcnt / linear combination
* [ ] Naive popcnt without AVX so you can run it regardles of your CPU
* [ ] Makefile AVX512 auto (atm to compile with avx512, you have to use `make "CFLAGS=-mavx512f -mavx512bw"` which is kinda ugly)

# Dependencies
